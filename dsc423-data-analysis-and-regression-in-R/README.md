1. [DSC423_A2.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc423-data-analysis-and-regression-in-R/DSC423_A2.pdf)
    * Using R markdown. scatterplot matrix in R. correlation matrix in R. Fit a linear regression model and compute VIF statistics to check for multicollinearity.
    * compare coefficient of determination R2 and adjusted R2. create residual plots in R. qq-plots. linear regression test for influencial points / outliers in R. 
    * more linear regression models and predicted vs residuals plots looking for random scatter to show linearity. impact of changing beta values on prediction from linear regression.
    * 95% confidence intervals for different values input for the betas.
2. [DSC423_A3.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc423-data-analysis-and-regression-in-R/DSC423_A3.pdf)
    * exploratory data analysis and linear modeling for college dataset. multicollinearity checks. removing insignificant variables.
    * linear modeling with backward feature selection and forward feature selection
    * predicted vs residuals looking for random scatter to show linearity, qq plot analysis looking for all along line for normality, outlier detection outside -3,3 bounds for studentized residuals.
    * coefficient of determination R2 represents the amount of variation in Y explained by the regression model. The adjusted R2 also describes the amount of variation in Y explained by the regression model but isn't sensitive/altered by simply adding more terms. F statistic with low p value to reject null hypothesis
    * analysis of interaction terms significance, linear regression model, beta parameter estimates, 
    * apply 5-fold cross validation and compute mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to tell by what percentage off predictions are on average from the actuals

    * churn analysis in R. boxplots. Logistic Regression in R with backward feature selection to predict churn.
