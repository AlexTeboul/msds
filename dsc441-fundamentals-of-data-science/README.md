# DSC 441: Fundamentals of Data Science

1. [DSC441_A1.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc441-fundamentals-of-data-science/DSC441_A1.pdf)
    * classification vs clustering, classification and prediciton, feature selection and feature extraction, data mining and SQL, data warehouses vs data marts
    * data mining tasks - what is vs isn't data mining.
    * iris dataset analysis in SPSS. scatterplots, descriptive statistics, histograms, boxplots in SPSS. Paper review.
2. [DSC441_A2.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc441-fundamentals-of-data-science/DSC441_A2.pdf)
    * Boxplots, skewness & kurtosis, Q-Q plots in SPSS. 
    * z-score normalization, min-max normalization, decimal scaling normalization
    * scatter plot interpretations, correlation matrices vs covariance matrices
    * equal-depth and equal-width partitioning
    * calculating entropy and information gain from scratch. using it to choose best attribute from scratch.
    * Spotify dataset analysis in SPSS.
3. [DSC441_A3.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc441-fundamentals-of-data-science/DSC441_A3.pdf)
    * Decision Trees for Lupus diagnosis in SPSS. Independent variable importances with CRT / visualize feature importances.
    * Decision Trees for red wine quality dataset predictions plus impact of binning.
4. [DSC441_A4.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc441-fundamentals-of-data-science/DSC441_A4.pdf)
    * Questions on KNN computation, accuracy, regression, and sensitivity to number of features.
    * Decision Tree vs KNN capabilities, ROC - AUC interpretation 
    * High sensitivity vs high specificity which is better for a given scenario. (should actually be sensitivity in this case)
    * Letter recognition tabular dataset decision tree and KNN
5. [DSC441_A5.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc441-fundamentals-of-data-science/DSC441_A5.pdf)
    * k-means clustering on seeds dataset. euclidean distance similarity measure. importance of normalization in KNN and k-means.
    * Choosing a k value plus scree-plot.
    * heirarchical clustering with single linkage algorithm and show dendrogram. again with complete linkage. Compare with k-means on purity. write an executive summary on it.
    * Decision trees and 3-D scatters in SPSS.
