## [DSC 424: Advanced Data Analysis in R](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/tree/main/dsc424-advanced-data-analysis-R)
1. [DSC424-HousingPriceAnalysis-Paper.pdf](https://github.com/AlexTeboul/msds/blob/main/dsc424-advanced-data-analysis-R/DSC424-HousingPriceAnalysis-Paper.pdf)
    * This paper explores the relationship between home features and sale prices using a combination of exploratory and predictive techniques. More specifically, we seek to answer the question of what home features influence the sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa. We performed a principal component analysis, common factor analysis, random forest classification, and linear regression in R. Our principal component analysis and common factor analysis uncovered key underlying structures regarding quality, quantity, and room types as the most significant features to explain our data. Through the use of random forest classification and linear regression, we determined that features that add value to a home are commonly associated with larger square footage and the perceived newness of a home, such as when it was built or remodeled.
    * **Keywords**: principal component analysis, common factor analysis, random forest classification, linear regression, home prices, real-estate
